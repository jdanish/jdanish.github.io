GEM stands for Generalized Embodied Modeling. Through these embodied, play-as-modeling activities, students will learn the core concepts of science, and the conceptual skills of modeling and systematic measurement. MR environments use new sensing technologies to help transform young children's physical actions during pretend play into a set of symbolic representations and parameters in a science simulation. As students physically move around the classroom, the computer will track their motion and interactions with selected objects and translate their physical activity into a shared display. For example, students pretend they are water particles and work together to model different states of matter. The children see their activity projected onto a computer simulation where a model of a water particle is displayed over the video of themselves. As students collectively reflect upon the nature of a water molecule, they refine their understanding of water as ice, a liquid or a gas. The proposed innovation allows the students to program and revise their own mixed reality simulations as part of their modeling cycle. Embodied and computational modeling will help students to reflect on their models in a unique way that will make their models more computationally accurate and enhance their understanding of the underlying concepts.","People":"**PI**: Dr. Joshua Danish (IU), **Co-PI**: Dr. Noel Enyedy (Vanderbilt)","degrees":"7","filteredTransparency":1,"color":"#eeeeee","opacity":1,"size":5,"selected":false,"selectedSecondary":false,"textColor":"#333","strokeColor":"#fff","strokeWidth":"3px","help":"Id: 1\nLabel: Generalized Embodied Modeling (GEM-STEP)\nType: Project\nAbstract: Add lots of text here.\nPeople: PI: Dr. Joshua Danish\nDegrees: 0\nCreated By: JD-SUPPORT-VNZ\nUpdated By: JD-SUPPORT-VNZ","website":"[embodiedplay.org](https://embodiedplay.org/) [https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1908791](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1908791)","agency":"NSF","program":"Discovery Research K-12"},{"id":2,"label":"Science Education","provenance":[],"createdBy":"JD-SUPPORT-VNZ","updatedBy":"JD-SUPPORT-VNZ\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["JD-SUPPORT-VNZ","JD-SUPPORT-VNZ","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"meta":{"created":1728416718000,"updated":1731075660167,"revision":1},"$loki":2,"type":"Topic / Interest","abstract":"","website":"","People":"","degrees":"6","agency":"","program":""},{"id":4,"label":"Embodied Cognition and Learning","provenance":[],"createdBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7","updatedBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"meta":{"created":1728478298000,"updated":1731075660167,"revision":1},"$loki":4,"type":"Topic / Interest","abstract":"","website":"","People":"","degrees":"1","agency":"","program":""},{"meta":{"created":1728572493000,"updated":1731075660167,"revision":1},"id":5,"label":"Engage AI","type":"Project","abstract":"**AI Institute for Engaged Learning**: Emerging breakthroughs in AI create significant and timely opportunities for accelerating innovation relevant to pressing national challenges in STEM education.

Further, while STEM teaching represents one of the areas of highest need, STEM teachers leave the profession at high rates. These developments call for innovative workforce augmentation technologies to improve K-12 STEM teachers' performance and quality of work-life.

Middle school years are crucial in shaping youth dispositions toward STEM. There is an urgent need nationally to develop a deep educational understanding of how to engage students during these years in learning AI and how to train and support teachers in AI education. The need to provide AI learning experiences is especially pronounced in rural areas, where students often lack access to advanced STEM educational opportunities.

With rapid advances in a wide array of AI and machine learning capabilities, these technologies are quickly finding broad application in every sector of the economy. The growing recognition of the demand for an AI-literate workforce highlights the urgent need to develop a deep understanding of how to introduce K-12 students to AI and how to support K-12 teachers in this endeavor. Because the elementary grades are a critical time for developing students? positive perceptions and dispositions toward STEM, creating engaging AI learning experiences for elementary grade students is of paramount importance. Similarly, developing disciplinary core ideas in life science in the elementary grades is important for creating enduring understanding of and interest in STEM for diverse learners. However, AI has been conspicuously absent from elementary education, and there has been limited research examining AI learning and teaching at the elementary level. A key open question for AI elementary education is how can students be introduced to the fundamentals of AI in the context of its application to solving core science problems? This question poses significant challenges because addressing it entails developing a socio-cognitive account of student learning processes and outcomes that can be used to inform the design of an integrated AI and science curriculum. By embedding AI in elementary life science education, researchers of this project will investigate how to meet the demand for targeted AI education while simultaneously creating innovative approaches to robust life science learning at the elementary level.

While these spaces offer opportunity for individuals and multi-generational groups to work together, there is also more broad interest in structured youth programming that involves maker-related activities and content. Yet, research-informed professional development that focuses on how informal educators implement, plan, and handle ongoing, just-in-time support during moments of failure is scarce. Prior research supports the important role of failure in maker programming to increase learning, resilience, self-efficacy and other skills such as independence. This project will address the gap through adapting, implementing, and refining a professional development program for informal educators to productively attend, interpret, and respond to youths' experiences with failure while engaged in maker programs. The contexts for this research are museums that provide maker programming. This Innovations in Development project uses a train-the-trainer approach to professional development. Up to two lead facilitators at each partnering institution experience an initial three-day workshop and ongoing support meetings during the first phase. In the second phase, the lead facilitators support other informal educators at their institution implementing making programs for youth. This project will enhance the infrastructure for research and education as collaborations and professional learning communities will be established among a variety of informal learning institutions.

Using a modified Delphi study with a diverse panel of experts, our project seeks to address the research question: *What capacities do youth need to become inventive problem solvers?* Anticipated contributions of this project include developing consensus around: a) the capacities youth need to make them ready to be inventive problem-solvers, b) outward indicators to measure these capacities, and c) educational approaches that are most likely to develop these capacities.

Furthermore, teachers may not know how to engage students in productive classroom conversations that make use of, critique, or refine representations. In short, there are two key inter-related dimensions to teachers’ knowledge of representations in science: 1) an understanding of representations and their value in learning concepts, and 2) the ability to support productive use of representations within classroom conversations, and facilitate discussions which help students see representations as part of their scientific practices.","website":"[https://reptalproject.org/](https://reptalproject.org/) [https://grants.jsmf.org/220020521/](https://grants.jsmf.org/220020521/)","People":"**PI**: Dr. Joshua Danish (IU), **Co-PI**: Dr. Cindy Hmelo-Silver (IU), **Co-PI**: Dr. Heidi Carlone (Vanderbilt), **Co-PI**: Dr. Dionne Cross Francis (NC State), **Co-PI**: Dr. Noel Enyedy (Vanderbilt), **Co-PI**: Dr. Jose-Felipe Martinez (UCLA), **Co-PI**: Dr. Meredith Park Rogers (IU)","degrees":"6","createdBy":"","updatedBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"$loki":28,"agency":"James McDonnell Foundation","program":"Understanding Human Cognition"},{"id":29,"label":"High School Education","provenance":[],"createdBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7","updatedBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"meta":{"created":1728573616000,"updated":1731075660169,"revision":1},"$loki":29,"type":"Topic / Interest","abstract":"","website":"","People":"","degrees":"1","agency":"","program":""},{"id":30,"label":"Undergraduate Education","provenance":[],"createdBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7","updatedBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"meta":{"created":1728573638000,"updated":1731075660169,"revision":1},"$loki":30,"type":"Topic / Interest","abstract":"","website":"","People":"","degrees":"2","agency":"","program":""},{"id":32,"label":"Curriculum / Course Design","provenance":[],"createdBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7","updatedBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"meta":{"created":1728575711000,"updated":1731075660169,"revision":1},"$loki":32,"type":"Topic / Interest","abstract":"","website":"","People":"","degrees":"5","agency":"","program":""},{"meta":{"created":1728576604000,"updated":1731075660170,"revision":1},"id":33,"label":"Net.Create","type":"Project","abstract":"**Net.Create: Using Network Analysis to Support Digital Humanities in Large History Classrooms**: This is an EAGER award to use Network Analysis to Support Digital Humanities Learning in Large History Classrooms.

Net.Create will also give practical guidance for how instructors in a variety of disciplines with similar complex interactions can adapt network visualization and analysis skills, typically the focus of STEM disciplines, to support students as they engage with humanities and social science learning.","website":"[https://netcreate.org/](https://netcreate.org/) [https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1848655](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1848655)","People":"**PI**: Dr. Kalani Craig (IU), **Co-PI**: Dr. Joshua Danish (IU), **Co-PI**: Dr. Cindy Hmelo-Silver (IU), **Co-PI**: Dr. Ann McCranie (IU)","degrees":"4","createdBy":"","updatedBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7\r\"\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"$loki":33,"agency":"NSF","program":"EAGER"},{"id":34,"label":"Modeling / Representations","provenance":[],"createdBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7","updatedBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"meta":{"created":1728658067000,"updated":1731075660170,"revision":1},"$loki":34,"type":"Topic / Interest","agency":"","program":"","abstract":"","website":"","People":"","degrees":"6"},{"id":35,"label":"Teacher Expertise","provenance":[],"createdBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7","updatedBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"meta":{"created":1728658323000,"updated":1731075660170,"revision":1},"$loki":35,"type":"Topic / Interest","agency":"","program":"","abstract":"","website":"","People":"","degrees":"3"},{"id":37,"label":"Examining Equity in K-12 Computer Science Policies, Practices, and Pathways","provenance":[],"createdBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7","updatedBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"meta":{"created":1729523172000,"updated":1731075660170,"revision":1},"$loki":37,"type":"Project","agency":"National Science Foundation","program":"","abstract":"Through an examination of state-level enrollment data, sources, and documents, we are examining students' and teachers' engagement opportunities and experiences in CS education.","People":"Dr. Anne Leftwich","website":"","degrees":"3"},{"id":38,"label":"CS Teacher Education Programs","provenance":[],"createdBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7","updatedBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"meta":{"created":1729523360000,"updated":1731075660170,"revision":1},"$loki":38,"type":"Project","agency":"Google CS-ER 2019","abstract":"This research group is focused on examining how elementary and secondary teacher education programs are preparing preservice teachers to teach CS.","People":"Dr. Anne Leftwhich, Dr. Brush, Jiyoung Kim, Jake Koressel, Hyejeong Lee, Lin Chu","program":"","website":"","degrees":"4"},{"id":39,"label":"CS High Schooler's Experiences","provenance":[],"createdBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7","updatedBy":"CRLT-TEAM-GP7\r\"\r\"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"meta":{"created":1729523458000,"updated":1731075660170,"revision":1},"$loki":39,"type":"Project","abstract":"This research group is focused on examining high school students experiences in CS courses.

instructional decisions and these decisions shape the mathematical learning opportunities for all students. This is particularly important when considering the learning opportunities for groups that have historically been marginalized in mathematics, including girls and students of color. There are few validated, mathematics-specific instruments that measure teachers' beliefs about mathematics learning related to race, ethnicity, and gender. This project seeks to investigate teachers' beliefs related to how they explain the systemic racial and gender differences in mathematics education outcomes by developing and validating a survey instrument and to explore how those beliefs might impact their teaching. The central hypothesis of the project is that teachers' beliefs about attributions of mathematical excellence interact with students' racial and gender identities to cause racial and gender inequity in the learning opportunities available to students in the same mathematics classrooms. The basis of these beliefs may be attributions to genetic, social, or personal characteristics that are based in biased and inaccurate conceptions of the sources of mathematical excellence.","website":"[https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2200990&HistoricalAwards=false](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2200990&HistoricalAwards=false)","People":"","degrees":"4","createdBy":"","updatedBy":"\r\"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7","CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"$loki":75},{"meta":{"created":1731010357000,"updated":1731075660172,"revision":1},"id":76,"label":"Assessing the Structure of Knowledge","type":"Project","agency":"NSF","program":"DRK-12; ECR-EDU Core Research","abstract":"**Assessing the Structure of Knowledge in Teaching Mathematics** Understanding how elementary teachers' mathematical knowledge for teaching develops and how it influences instruction and student learning has been a persistent challenge in mathematics education.

Currently middle school mathematics instruction in a single classroom is often not differentiated for different thinkers, which can bore some students or overly challenge others. One way schools often deal with different thinkers at the same grade level is by tracking, which has also been shown to have deleterious effects on students, both cognitively and affectively. In addition, students continue to struggle to learn algebra, and increasing numbers of middle school students are receiving algebra instruction. The proposed project initiates new research and an integrated education plan to address these problems by investigating (1) how to effectively differentiate instruction for middle school students at different reasoning levels; and (2) how to foster middle school students' algebraic reasoning and rational number knowledge in mutually supportive ways. Educational goals of the project are to enhance the abilities of prospective and practicing teachers to teach cognitively diverse students, to improve doctoral students' understanding of relationships between students' learning and teachers' practice, and to form a community of mathematics teachers committed to on-going professional learning about how to differentiate instruction.","website":"[https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1252575](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1252575)","People":"","degrees":"","createdBy":"","updatedBy":"\r","_nlog":["CRLT-TEAM-GP7"],"$loki":77}],"edges":[{"id":1,"source":1,"attributes":{},"provenance":[],"createdBy":"JD-SUPPORT-VNZ","updatedBy":"JD-SUPPORT-VNZ","_elog":["JD-SUPPORT-VNZ","JD-SUPPORT-VNZ"],"meta":{"revision":1,"created":1728416727739,"version":0,"updated":1728416737625},"$loki":1,"target":2,"type":"Related
