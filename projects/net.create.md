Net.Create was originally developed to support undergraduate history classrooms, with a focus on how dynamic, collaboratively constructed visualization could help students see both big-picture patterns and local nuance in a large text (e.g., a data set). We immediately saw the potential of this approach for exploring complex data sets across a range of ages and topics. Subsequent experimentations included creating a network visualization for several undergraduate and graduate level courses, as well as a visualization of our research team's overlapping interests in hobbies and research topics. In our most recent iteration, we've explored how this kind of visualization can serve as a space for exploring collective identity, data literacy, and other concepts in middle-school classrooms.

Here is a small network showing the relationship between RAPT, our research interests, and Net.Create:
