While the original Net.Create tool was developed to support undergraduate history classrooms, this kind of collaborative network visualiation is proving well-suited to helping students explore data in a wide range of contexts. Recently, we have used this network visualization in graduate level theory courses, and in helping middle school students explore their interests and identities. 

You can see a sample network depicting the readings in our graduate level Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) course <a href="https://joshuadanish.com/nc/index.html?dataset=CHAT#/" target="net.create">here</a>. To see the kind of network we envision sharing with youth to explore their interests, see a simple network we developed based on some of our own interests <a href="https://joshuadanish.com/nc/index.html?dataset=VFOI1#/" target="net.create">here</a>. If you'd like to learn more about either of these efforts, please email jdanish [a] indiana.edu.
